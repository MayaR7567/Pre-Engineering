About Digital Electronics
Digital Electronics is what made me want to do Computer Science. Orginally I saw the class and thought this is cool I can learn to wire things.
The class is so much more than that. It is binary, logic gates, logic expressions, simplifying, k-mapping, breadboards, multsim, and jsut all around so interesting.
I loved this class so much that when my teacher asked me to be her peer tutor the next year I said yes straight away.
I ended up teaching half of the semester due to the teacher being away on surgery leave. 
There is something so peaceful about sititng down doing the logic expressions, drawing the circuits, and wiring them by hand.
