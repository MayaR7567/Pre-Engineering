About Engineering Design and Development
EDD was the capstone class of my pre-engineering program. It was about forming a team to invent or innvoate a solution for a poroblem in the world.
I was in the first class ever to have enough girls to form a team. Therfore sticking with the theme we chose to tackle the issue of sexual assault with the creation of a self defense ring.
Researching the topic was honestly stressful as I knew the problem was bad but it is truly shocking how many people it affects. 
At the end of the project we competed against the other teams in the class to determine who would go onto the state SkillsUSA Engineering Technology/Design competition. 
My team ended up going to state to present our project. We came in 2nd! It was a grueling project but it really showed what comes into creating projects.
