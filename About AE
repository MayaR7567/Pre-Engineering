About Aerospace Engineering
My Aerospace engineering class was so much fun. There were only 5 of us in the whole class which allowed us to do a lot more projects than normal.
We learned about the math side of aerospace with weight calculations for planes, oribtal periods of planets/objects, etc.
But we also got do learn things in a fun way such as the Glider project in which we all created wooden gliders with different airfoil shapes. Then we launched them to see which shape generated the most lift.
We also imitiated a rover with a vex robot and camera. We were challenged to build, program, and control the robot to find objects located in another room.
While not the area I wanted to study the class was an amazing way to learn about aerospace.
